 The raw data file 'c,rfDC' contains simulated data for the
248 magnetometer channels (A1-A248) and the TRIGGER channel.
Peak amplitudes are approx. <n>*30fT for A<n>, i.e., the
amplitude increases with the channel number.

The filtered datafile 'c,rfDC,fn50,o' has been created
by applying the 4D/BTi-filter program (50Hz-notch; MSW 1.3.8)
and fills the 'offset'-field behind the 'off_flag' in the
file header. (Cf. Issue #6048)
